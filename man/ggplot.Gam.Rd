\title{ggplot‑based term plots for a Gam object}
\usage{
ggplot.Gam(
  x,
  residuals = NULL,
  rugplot = TRUE,
  se = FALSE,
  scale = 0,
  ask = FALSE,
  terms = labels.Gam(x),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{Gam} object, or a \code{preplot.Gam} object. The
first thing \code{plot.Gam()} does is check if \code{x} has a
component called \code{preplot}; if not, it computes one using
\code{preplot.Gam()}. Either way, it is this \code{preplot.Gam}
object that is required for plotting a \code{Gam} object.}

\item{residuals}{if \code{TRUE}, partial deviance residuals are
plotted along with the fitted terms---default is \code{FALSE}. If
\code{residuals} is a vector with the same length as each fitted
term in \code{x}, then these are taken to be the overall
residuals to be used for constructing the partial residuals.}

\item{rugplot}{if \code{TRUE} (the default), a univariate histogram
or \code{rugplot} is displayed along the base of each plot,
showing the occurrence of each \code{x}; ties are broken by jittering.}

\item{se}{if \code{TRUE}, upper and lower pointwise
twice-standard-error curves are included for each plot. The
default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{scale}{a lower limit for the number of units covered by the
limits on the \code{y} for each plot. The default is \code{scale=0},
in which case each plot uses the range of the functions being
plotted to create their \code{ylim}. By setting \code{scale} to
be the maximum value of \code{diff(ylim)} for all the plots, then
all subsequent plots will produced in the same vertical
units. This is essential for comparing the importance of fitted
terms in additive models.}

\item{ask}{if \code{TRUE}, \code{plot.Gam()} operates in interactive mode.}

\item{terms}{subsets of the terms can be selected}

\item{...}{Additonal plotting arguments, not all of which will
work (like xlim)}
}
\value{
(invisibly) a named list of \code{ggplot} objects.
        When \code{ask = FALSE} the plots are printed
        sequentially.  When \code{ask = TRUE} a menu lets you
        choose which term(s) to draw, exactly as in
        \code{plot.Gam()}.
}
\description{
A faithful re‑implementation of \code{plot.Gam()} that
produces one \code{ggplot} object per model term (main effects
of one or two predictors).  All arguments mirror those of
\code{plot.Gam()} so existing code can simply replace the
function name.
